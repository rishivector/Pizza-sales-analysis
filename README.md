Preferred Size: Large pizzas account for nearly 45% of all sales, indicating a trend towards group orders.

Best Sellers: "The Classic Deluxe Pizza" and "The Barbecue Chicken Pizza" are major revenue drivers.

Underperformers: "The Brie Carre Pizza" is the lowest-selling item, suggesting a need for marketing intervention or menu re-evaluation.
